# World Model Harness

`wmh` makes it easy to go from agent traces to faithful replication of your production environment where your agents run.

Basically, an LLM pretends to be a virtual machine executing instructions — but it's 5x faster than a real sandbox.

Just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/experientiallabs/world-model-harness
cd world-model-harness
uv sync
uv run wmh build
```

The `build` command opens a wizard that walks you through creating your own world model from your traces.

Below is a comparison running 8 SWE-bench tasks: real sandboxes on the left, a world model acting as the sandbox on the right.

## How it works

A frontier LLM acts as the *environment* your agent steps against, reconstructed from your own OpenTelemetry traces. Inspired by **Qwen-AgentWorld** (LLM-as-environment), **GEPA** (reflective prompt evolution), and **DreamGym** (retrieval over a trace replay buffer) — but with **zero training**: we get there with prompt optimization on a frontier model.

1. **Build** from your OTel traces: ingest → normalize → split train/held-out → index a replay buffer → evolve the env prompt with GEPA against the held-out split.
2. **Serve**: agents call `WorldModel.step(action)` (in-process or via the local HTTP backend). Each step retrieves the most similar past `(state, action) → observation` examples and predicts the next observation.

## Try it

```bash
uv run wmh examples list          # swe-bench, tau-bench, terminal-tasks
uv run wmh eval list              # eval suites shipped with the examples
uv run wmh eval run tau-bench     # replay + score reconstruction fidelity
uv run wmh play                   # step into the environment yourself
uv run wmh serve                  # local HTTP backend on :8000
```

Example-local prebuilt models live under `examples/<task>/models/`; pass `--root examples/<task>` to `wmh list`, `wmh demo`, `wmh play`, or `wmh serve` to use one without rebuilding.

## Use it as an API

```python
from wmh import Action, ActionKind
from wmh.config.store import WorldModelStore
from wmh.engine.loader import load_world_model

model_dir = WorldModelStore(".wmh").resolve("airline")
wm, _provider = load_world_model(model_dir)

session = wm.new_session(task="check out the cart")
obs = wm.step(session.id, Action(kind=ActionKind.TOOL_CALL, name="add_to_cart",
                                 arguments={"sku": "A1"}))
print(obs.content)
```

Or over HTTP (same code path), namespaced by model name: `GET /world_models`, then `POST /world_models/{name}/sessions` and `POST /world_models/{name}/sessions/{id}/step`.

## Providers

One interface, four backends, verified on startup. Credentials are read from the environment:

| Provider | Model | Env vars |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | Claude Opus | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| AWS Bedrock | Claude Opus | `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| Azure OpenAI | GPT | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` |
| OpenAI | GPT | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

## Development

Managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); linting/formatting with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/); type checking with [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty). Conventions live in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

```bash
uv sync --extra dev      # env + dev tools
uv run ruff check .      # lint
uv run ruff format .     # format
uv run ty check          # type check
uv run pytest -q         # tests
