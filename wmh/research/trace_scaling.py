"""Trace scaling law — how world-model fidelity grows with the number of training traces.

The question: feed the harness *more* recorded traces and does its reconstruction fidelity keep
climbing, or saturate? This experiment sweeps the TRAIN trace count (10, 20, 50, … up to the corpus
size) against a **fixed** held-out test set and reports fidelity at each count, so the curve is a
clean "data in → fidelity out" law rather than a moving target (see `scaling_split`).

Two curves, selectable so the cheap one can scout the range before the expensive one runs:

- `base` — the bundled `BASE_ENV_PROMPT`, scored on the fixed test set with a retrieval buffer built
  from the `n` train traces. Isolates how far retrieval *alone* scales (no GEPA, cheap).
- `gepa` — GEPA optimizes the prompt on the `n` train traces, selecting against the fixed valid set,
  then the winning prompt is scored on the fixed test set. The real "learning from more traces"
  curve (one GEPA run per count × seed — expensive).

It is an `Ablation` like every other experiment: conditions = mode × trace-count, swept across seeds
by `run_ablation`, so the across-seed std gives error bars at each point for free. Each `run` reuses
the canonical `optimize_prompt` / `score_prompt` (the same GEPA + replay the harness ships), so the
metric is comparable to `wmh eval` and any judge upgrade lands here automatically. Backends are
factory-injected, so the unit test drives it with fakes and the `scripts/` runner with live Bedrock.

Extensible across benchmarks: it takes an already-ingested corpus and a base prompt, so tau2 today
and terminal-tasks / swe-bench tomorrow are just a different trace file in — no code change.
