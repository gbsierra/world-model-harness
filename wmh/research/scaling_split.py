"""Fixed-test, growing-train split for the trace-scaling-law experiment.

The scaling law asks "how does world-model fidelity grow as we feed GEPA + retrieval *more* training
traces?" To read that curve cleanly the evaluation target must not move: we hold a **fixed** test
set (and a fixed valid set GEPA selects on) and vary only how many TRAIN traces the run sees.

Two deterministic carves, both stable as the corpus grows so a checked-in run reproduces:

1. `partition_corpus` hashes each `trace_id` into [0, 1) (the same blake2b trick as
   `wmh.engine.build.split_traces`) and slices fixed `test` / `valid` bands off the top; everything
   else is the train *pool*. A trace's band depends only on its id, so adding more traces never
   moves an existing trace between test / valid / pool — the test set a run reports on is identical
   at every trace count.
2. `subsample_train` takes `n` traces from that pool in a seed-shuffled order. The order is fixed
   for a given seed, so the n=10 sample is a prefix of the n=20 sample (nested): each step up the
   curve *adds* traces rather than resampling, isolating the effect of corpus size.

Counts are capped at what the pool holds, so the same code runs on a small corpus or the committed
~1000-trace tau2 one without change — it just stops the curve where the data runs out.
