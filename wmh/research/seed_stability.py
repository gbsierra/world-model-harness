"""GEPA seed-stability — the harness's first concrete experiment.

GEPA's search is stochastic: the reflection LM samples at temperature 1.0, and the engine seed
drives minibatch sampling and candidate selection. So two builds of the *same* corpus with the same
budget can land on different evolved prompts. This experiment quantifies that: it runs GEPA across N
seeds and measures the spread of held-out fidelity. A small std means GEPA is reproducible (any seed
is fine); a large std means the winning prompt is seed-dependent and a real build should sweep seeds
and keep the best.

Unlike a temperature sweep (parked — see docs/research_directions.md — because the shipped
providers reject sampling params), this needs no sampling knob: it varies only the GEPA engine
`seed`, plumbed through `GEPAOptimizer`. Fidelity is scored with whatever `Judge` the caller injects
— pass `RubricJudge` to score on the canonical 5 dimensions, exactly as `wmh eval` does.

Dependency-injected: it takes a factory for the (provider, judge, embedder) trio and the
already-split train/held-out traces, so the unit test drives it with fakes and the `scripts/` runner
drives it with live Bedrock — same code path.
