"""The ablation framework: sweep named conditions across seeds, aggregate mean + std.

An *ablation* answers "does knob X change the outcome?" empirically and reproducibly. The contract:

- A `Condition` is a named bundle of knob values (e.g. `train_temp=0.0, eval_temp=1.0`).
- An `Ablation` (Protocol) knows its `conditions()` and how to `run(condition, seed) -> float`
  (one build+eval at one seed, returning a scalar metric — higher is better).
- `run_ablation` is the generic driver: for every condition × seed it calls `run`, collects the
  scalars, and aggregates per-condition mean + (population) std across seeds.

Aggregation is intentionally simple (mean + std, no CIs/significance tests): small trace corpora
make fancier statistics false precision. Adding a new experiment is "write one `Ablation`"; the
driver, seed sweep, and reporting are reused.
