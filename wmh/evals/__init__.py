"""World-model evaluation: one interface, an open-loop and a closed-loop implementation.

- `base` — the general `Evaluation`/`EvalResult` interface: mode-specific inputs are bound at
  construction; `run()` returns a report with a one-line `summary()` and a `headline` score.
- `open_loop` — teacher-forced replay of held-out trace steps, scored for per-step reconstruction
  fidelity (the default `wmh eval` mode).
- `closed_loop` — a live agent runs tasks with the world model as its environment, gold-judged for
  end-to-end task success over k=3 passes (`wmh eval --mode closed-loop`).
- `agreement` — compare two closed-loop reports task-by-task (e.g. simulated vs real): the
  outcome-agreement validity check.
- `gold` / `tasks` — the gold-assertion judge and the task specs closed-loop eval scores against.
