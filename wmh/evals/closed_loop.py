"""Closed-loop scoring: run a live agent on tasks against an environment, judge task success.

Open-loop eval (`wmh/engine/eval.py`, the default `wmh eval` mode) replays recorded steps
teacher-forced and scores per-step fidelity. This module is the closed-loop counterpart
(`wmh eval --mode closed-loop`): for each task, the agent loop runs to completion (submit or turn
cap) and the `GoldJudge` scores the transcript against the task's gold assertions. Per the repo's
eval convention, every task runs **k=3 passes** and metrics are means over the passes — never
single-pass.

The environment is a factory parameter: `evaluate_closed_loop` binds it to the world model
(`WorldModelEnvironment`), and any real execution backend can bind the same core through the
`AgentEnvironment` protocol, producing a directly comparable report (see
`wmh.evals.agreement`).
