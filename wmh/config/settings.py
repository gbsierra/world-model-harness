    validity gates) and should be a different model family from `worker` so the grader carries
    no self-preference bias toward the generator's outputs; `summary` does high-volume cheap
    extraction (trace facets/digests); `meta` is the harness-search delta proposer, which
    needs a long-context, long-output model (one proposal holds every harness surface in its
    prompt and replies with a complete replacement surface); `agent` is the agent-under-test
    whose harness `wmh optimize` searches. Set it to optimize a harness for a model
    distinct from the world model's serve provider (e.g. a small self-hosted agent against a
    frontier-served world model). Unset `judge`/`summary` fall back to `worker`; each command
