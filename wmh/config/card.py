"""The v0 ModelCard: descriptive metadata a built world model carries in its artifact.

`card.json` sits in the artifact root next to `config.toml` and is what distribution surfaces
(the website gallery, `GET /world_models`, future `wmh export`/`pull`) render. The shape follows
the registry contract sketch in the coordination plan (PLAN.md §2.1); WS-A4 owns and extends it.
A model without a card still loads everywhere - cards are additive metadata, never required.
