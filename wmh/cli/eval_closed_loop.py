"""`wmh eval --mode closed-loop` and `wmh eval agreement` — the closed-loop halves of eval.

Kept out of `app.py` so the (large) eval command stays readable; `app.py` routes here.
Closed-loop mode runs an agent harness against a built world model — the environment is ALWAYS
the world-model simulation; `--harness-backend e2b` only moves the pi-node harness PROCESS into
pooled E2B sandboxes (its tool calls stay answered host-side) — and scores task success;
`agreement` compares two saved closed-loop reports — the outcome-agreement check
docs/reference/closed_loop.md names.
