"""Benchmarks as first-class, persisted objects on top of the open-loop eval scorer.

A *benchmark* is a committed, versioned definition (`benchmarks/<name>/benchmark.toml`): a named set
of recorded trace files plus an eval config (sample-turns, rollouts, seeds, judge). `wmh bench run`
scores a world-model prompt against it reproducibly — per seed, aggregating the rollout distribution
as MEAN + STD — and persists the result under `benchmarks/<name>/results/` ("filesystem as DB").
`wmh bench` / `wmh bench list` render a leaderboard over those persisted runs.

The scoring unit itself (replay a held-out trace teacher-forced, judge predicted vs. real
observation) lives in the eval layer (`wmh.engine.eval`); this package never reimplements it — it
calls it once per rollout and aggregates.
