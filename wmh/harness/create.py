"""`wmh harness create`: budgeted search over harness deltas, gated by non-regression.

Each iteration freezes the current champion, clusters its failures into mechanisms, and asks the
proposer for a sibling batch of `HarnessDelta` objects against one size-weighted,
expansion-discounted cluster. Every sibling is applied and evaluated against that same frozen
champion. After the full batch resolves, at most one gate-eligible sibling becomes the next
iteration's champion:

- **Tier 1 — regression suite**: the child's score on the suite (tasks the search has already
  mastered) must not drop below the champion's. Newly-passing tasks promote into the suite on
  accept, so wins are locked in and later deltas cannot quietly trade them away.
- **Tier 2 — full split**: the child's overall success rate must be at least the best seen.
- **Tier 3 — held-out (optional)**: with a holdout task file, the child must also be no worse than
  the champion on tasks the proposer never saw evidence from.

Ties pass every gate tier: with k passes per task, scores are coarse, and "no worse" is the
eligibility contract. When multiple siblings are eligible, full success wins, then assertion
fraction, then lower proposal index. Every proposed delta, whether selected, rejected, or invalid
before eval, is recorded in the archive with its verdict. The run as a whole is only as
reproducible as its providers because proposals and rollouts sample real models at temperature.

    """Search for a better harness under a fixed eval budget; the champion is renamed to `name`.

    Scores the seed first, then runs ``iterations`` proposal batches. Each iteration asks the
    proposer for ``proposal_batch_size`` siblings against the frozen champion, evaluates every
    sibling against that same snapshot, and selects at most one winner. A dead proposal
    (unusable, invalid, or screened out on its trigger cluster) ends early and cheaply. It is
    counted, recorded in ``proposal_records``, and narrated via ``on_note`` without aborting its
    siblings. ``on_proposal`` receives every final record in stable proposal order after
    selection. ``on_progress`` receives the seed plus exactly one champion point per iteration,
    including an unchanged point when no proposal wins. ``on_accept`` fires at most once per
    iteration with the selected champion, its final delta verdict, and its full-suite score.
    ``on_note`` is an eager diagnostic stream, so dead-proposal and feedback-error notes may fire
    while siblings are still evaluating. ``on_proposal`` waits for batch selection and then fires
    in stable proposal order. The iteration's ``on_progress`` checkpoint follows those records.

    ``on_sandbox_usage`` fires after the shared E2B pool is successfully closed on every exit
    path, including failures and cancellation, so callers can persist already-incurred evaluator
    spend without requiring a partial result. An unproven close raises instead of publishing a
    falsely final meter.
    ``should_cancel`` is checked before and after every score wave, before each proposal slot,
    and after each batched proposer call. E2B runtimes also poll it while waiting for runner
    frames, so cancellation aborts the active wave without judging partial cells. A provider/tool
    call already in progress remains bounded by that call's own timeout. Cancellation raises
    :class:`HarnessSearchCancelled` while the normal ``finally`` path retires sandbox resources.

    Every rollout scores against the world-model simulation — the environment is always sim.
    `harness_backend` picks where the harness PROCESS executes: `local` (the default) runs it
    in/from this process exactly as before; `e2b` runs the real pi agent inside E2B sandboxes
    (pi-node seeds only — that harness's context management is the thing under search), with its
    tool calls still answered by the world model host-side. One `E2BSandboxPool` is shared across
    score waves within a proposal batch, then its idle runners are retired before the next batch's
    proposer call. This amortizes bootstrap work across sibling proposals without carrying E2B
    command streams through the potentially long proposal gap between iterations. `eval_concurrency`
    is how many (task, attempt) cells run at once; `None` means the backend default — 1
    (sequential) for local, 0 (every cell at once, one pooled sandbox each) for e2b.
    `e2b_template` names a prebaked sandbox template (node 22 + the pi runner deps) so e2b
    rollouts skip bootstrap installs. `e2b_metadata` tags every sandbox created by the shared
    evaluation pool, including fresh replacements for retired runners.

    Verification is staged by cost: a child is first SCREENED on its own trigger cluster (the
    2-3 failing tasks its delta claims to fix, k passes). The screen is lexicographic: full-task
    success first, then assertion-level partial credit, so a real partial fix is not flattened
    into a binary tie. If neither signal improves, the delta is rejected and archived for a
    fraction of a full eval's cost. Repeated iterations discount
    their cluster on that parent, preventing one environment-limited singleton from absorbing the
    whole run. Held-out evals run only for children that pass tiers 1-2, so a bad delta costs at
    most one full-split eval. Every judged delta (screened, rejected, or accepted) is fed back to
    the proposer as history, so it iterates instead of re-proposing rejected ideas.

    Symmetrically, a REJECTION can be noise: with k passes over small tiers, one unlucky attempt
    can veto a genuine win. When `confirm_narrow_vetoes` is set, a delta that strictly won the
    full split but failed suite/holdout within `narrow_failing_tiers`' margin gets that tier
    re-measured — child AND champion, at 2k — and the re-measurement decides. The verdict records
    the retrial either way, so the archive shows which accepts needed confirmation.
