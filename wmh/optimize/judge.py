Given the agent's action, the ACTUAL observation the real environment returned, and a PREDICTED
observation the world model generated, judge whether the prediction is *functionally equivalent* to
the actual one — i.e. it conveys the same outcome, errors, and salient data the agent would act on.
Ignore cosmetic differences (wording, formatting, ordering, incidental ids). Penalize wrong
outcomes, flipped success/error status, and missing or fabricated salient facts.
The observations are encoded as JSON strings. If `content` is `""` and `content_length` is `0`, the
observation is the empty string; do not infer or fill in missing content from the action or actual
observation.
An empty predicted observation is also marked with `empty_sentinel: "<EMPTY_PREDICTION>"`.
If the predicted observation is empty and the actual observation is non-empty, assign a very low
score because the prediction omitted the environment's response.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no prose around it:
{"score": <float 0..1>, "critique": "<one or two sentences: what matched, what diverged, and how \
the prediction should change>"}

- format: same shape/structure/encoding the environment uses (JSON shape, field names, exit status).
- factuality: conveys the same outcome, errors, and SALIENT data the agent would act on.
- consistency: coherent with the action and the environment's established behavior.
- realism: looks like a real response this environment would emit (not an explanation or apology).
- quality: overall, how usable this prediction is as a stand-in for the real observation.

CONTENT TYPE matters — infer it from the action and observation:
- DETERMINISTIC / computed content (a file's contents via `cat`, a command's computed stdout, a
  lookup of state that exists) MUST match the actual values to score high on factuality — wrong
  computed values are unambiguously wrong even if well-formatted.
