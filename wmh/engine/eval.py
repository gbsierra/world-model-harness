"""Reconstruction-fidelity evaluation over trace files (the `wmh eval` backend).

`replay` (in `wmh.engine.replay`) scores one corpus of held-out steps. This orchestration layer is
what `wmh eval` calls: it loads one or more OTel trace files, splits each into train/holdout,
replays the holdout through a world-model prompt with leak-free RAG, and aggregates a per-file +
overall scorecard. Keeping it here (not in the CLI) keeps the command thin and the logic testable.
