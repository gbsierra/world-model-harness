"""Load a built world model from its artifact directory.

One place owns the "artifact dir -> live WorldModel" sequence (read config -> construct the serve
provider -> `WorldModel.load`). The CLI and the serving layer both call this so the loading path
stays identical no matter how the model was selected (by name, by picker, or served in bulk).
