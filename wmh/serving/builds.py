"""Serve-side world-model builds: kick off, watch (SSE), and register the finished model.

The website's build-your-own flow POSTs a build request; the manager runs the normal build
pipeline (`wmh.engine.build.build`) on a background thread, mirrors every `BuildReporter` event
into an in-memory log, and exposes that log both as a snapshot and as a Server-Sent-Events
stream. On success it writes the model's `card.json` and hands the fresh artifact to `register`
(the server adds it to the live serving set). One manager owns one writable store root.
