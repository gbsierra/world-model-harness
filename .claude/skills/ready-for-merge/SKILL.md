description: Mandatory pre-merge gate for every PR. Runs /code-review xhigh --fix, resolves every review comment (Cursor, Greptile, humans), and verifies the diff complies with AGENTS.md. Use whenever the user says a PR is ready to merge, asks to merge, or invokes /ready-for-merge.

# Ready for Merge

This is the **mandatory gate before merging any PR** in this repository. Do not merge, and do
not tell the user a PR is ready to merge, until every step below has been completed and passes.

Work against the PR for the current branch (`gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName`). If no
PR exists, stop and tell the user.

## Step 1 — Deep code review with fixes

Invoke the code-review skill at the highest effort level with fixes applied:

- Run the `code-review` skill with args `xhigh --fix`.

Let it finish and apply its fixes before moving on. If it applied changes, re-run the project
gate afterwards (see Step 3).

## Step 2 — Resolve every review comment on the PR

Fetch **all** comments and review threads on the PR — from Cursor (bugbot), Greptile, any other
bot reviewers, and human reviewers:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments --paginate
gh api graphql -f query='...reviewThreads(first: 100){ nodes { isResolved comments(first: 50){ nodes { author { login } body path line } } } }...'
```

For **every single comment**, without exception:

1. Read it and decide whether it is valid.
2. If valid: fix the code, then reply to the thread stating what was changed (reference the
   fix commit).
3. If invalid or out of scope: reply to the thread explaining *why* — never silently ignore it.
4. Mark the thread resolved (GraphQL `resolveReviewThread`) once addressed.

The step is done only when zero unresolved review threads remain. Re-check with the GraphQL
query above; do not assume.

## This process is iterative — wait for reviewers to react

Every time you push fixes, Cursor and Greptile re-review the PR and humans may leave new
comments. One pass is never enough. After each push:

1. Sleep 3 minutes to give bot reviewers time to run:
   ```bash
   sleep 180
   ```
2. Re-fetch all comments and review threads (same queries as Step 2).
3. If new unresolved comments appeared, handle them exactly as in Step 2 (fix or reply, then
   resolve), push, and repeat from 1.
4. Only exit the loop when a full 3-minute wait produces **zero** new comments and zero
   unresolved threads.

## Step 3 — AGENTS.md compliance

Read `AGENTS.md` in full and audit the PR's complete diff (`gh pr diff <number>`) against every
rule. In particular verify:

- Whole-project gate is clean: `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run ty check`,
  `uv run pytest -q`. If the PR touches `web/`, also run `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit`
  from `web/`.
- Module docstrings and Google-style docstrings on significant classes/functions.
- Tests live inline next to the code (`foo.py` → `foo_test.py`); new behavior has a test or eval
  that would catch its regression.
- No `Any`, bare `dict`/`object`, or untyped `**kwargs` where a concrete type is practical.
- No new top-level `benchmarks/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, or `world-models/` surfaces;
  dataset-specific logic stays under `examples/<task>/`.
- Imports at module scope, fail-fast; no silent `ImportError` fallbacks.
- End-to-end verification was actually done for anything with a runtime surface — drive it,
  don't just trust exit codes.
- Visuals (if any) follow the brand system.

Fix any violation found. Do not rationalize a violation as pre-existing if the PR touches that
code.

## Step 4 — Report

Push any fixes made in Steps 1–3, then report a checklist to the user:

- [ ] `/code-review xhigh --fix` completed (N findings, M fixed)
- [ ] All review comments resolved (list each commenter and how their comments were handled)
- [ ] AGENTS.md audit clean (note any rules that required fixes)
- [ ] Full project gate green
- [ ] Final 3-minute wait after the last push produced zero new comments

Only after all four boxes are checked may the PR be merged. If anything cannot be resolved,
report it as a blocker instead of merging.
