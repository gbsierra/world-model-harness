# RL smoke harness (tau-bench)

`smoke.py` exercises every wmh-side data path each downstream training chat will consume
end-to-end against the real tau-bench world model on Bedrock, at tiny scale (~30 haiku calls,
`max_steps=3`, 2 scenarios). It exists so we find interface problems in the RL seam here
before the transfer prompts spawn four training chats that would each hit the same wall.

## What it checks

Six paths, each independently PASS/FAIL:

1. **ICL** — one closed-loop episode via `run_episode(WorldModelEnv(wm), agent, task)`, then a
   scored follow-up rollout so we can build the augmented next-episode prompt that folds the
   reward-judge critique back in. This is the whole ICL story: no gradient, just critique-in-prompt.
2. **SFT** — chat-format dataset builder over two recorded train traces, one JSON example per
   step: `{messages: [system, user], completion: "<recorded tool call JSON>"}`. Shape only; no
   training.
3. **PPO / REINFORCE++** — n=1 rollout per scenario stepped directly against the WM
   (`new_session -> agent loop -> score_session -> end_session`), producing a batch of
   `{task_id, rollout_steps, reward, success, step_rewards}`.
4. **GRPO** — n=2 rollouts per scenario, grouped by `task_id`; group-relative advantages
   (`reward - group_mean`) computed and printed.
5. **SDPO** — one scored rollout emitted as a `{task, rollout, critique, reward}` feedback record
   where `critique` is `EpisodeScore.critique` (SDPO's tokenized teacher signal).
6. **HTTP** — the FastAPI seam claas-verl will actually call: `create_app` + `TestClient` in
   process, driving `session -> step -> score -> delete`.

## Run

```bash
uv run python packages/environment-capture/tau-bench/rl/smoke.py   # from repo root; AWS default profile, us-east-1
```

The script loads `packages/environment-capture/tau-bench/models/tau-bench/` (built config + retrieval index + optimized
prompt) but overrides the runtime provider to Bedrock haiku
(`us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`) for BOTH the serve model and the reward judge, so a
smoke doesn't cost Opus money. All 6 paths must PASS.

## Notes for the transfer-prompt chats

- **`run_episode` vs `WorldModel.score_session`.** `run_episode` opens its OWN session inside
  the `WorldModelEnv` and closes it on return, so you cannot call `wm.score_session(session.id)`
  on that same session afterwards. RL rollouts that need `score_session` should step the WM
  directly instead: `new_session -> agent.act loop -> score_session -> end_session`. That
  pattern is `_rollout_direct` in `smoke.py`. `run_episode` is still the right primitive for
  offline eval (compare against the real env) — just not for reward collection.
- **`_reward_provider` is currently module-private on `WorldModel`.** `WorldModel.load` only
  accepts one `provider`; if you want the reward judge on a different (cheaper) model you have to
  poke `wm._reward_provider` after loading. Consider promoting this to a `WorldModel.load(...,
  reward_provider=...)` kwarg before the training chats start; today's smoke works around it.
- **Bedrock model ids need the dated suffix on inference profiles.** `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-
  4-5` alone returns `ValidationException`; the full profile id
  `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` works. `wmh.tracking.pricing` already strips the
  suffix for the price lookup, so cost accounting still works.
- **Identical GRPO rollouts under temperature=0.** The default `provider.complete` is deterministic,
  so both rollouts in a group land on identical outputs and advantages collapse to 0. That is fine
  for wiring smoke; real GRPO training must pass a non-zero temperature (or top_p) so the group
  actually varies.
- **`scenarios_from_traces` first-seen order.** For a tau-bench train split it picks whatever
  trace hashed lowest first. If a downstream chat wants a specific scenario, filter/sort by
  `provenance` rather than assuming index 0 is stable across runs.
