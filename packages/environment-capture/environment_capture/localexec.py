"""A real local environment: bash commands executed in a workspace directory.

Each command runs in a fresh subshell with the workspace as cwd (no state leaks between
commands beyond the filesystem itself — the same discipline the shared-sandbox benchmarks use),
with stdout and stderr folded into one observation string, which is what the agent would see in
a terminal.

The environment is DEFINED as workspace-scoped: by default a command that targets host locations
(absolute host roots, `~`, `$HOME`, `cd ..`) is refused WITHOUT executing, and the refusal text
is the observation. This is a containment guard, not a sandbox — a determined command can still
reach the host through an interpreter — so corpora are additionally audited with
`environment_capture.hygiene` before they are committed.
